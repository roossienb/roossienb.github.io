Short what?

  

### Why Hydrogen?

Our current welfare is built upon an affordable and plentiful supply of energy. So far, this energy supply has been mainly dependent on fossil fuels. These include oil, oil derivatives like petrol, diesel and kerosene, natural gas and coal. 

#### Fossil fuels

Fossil fuels are found in large quantities in the earth's crust and are relatively easy to mine or extract, making them cheap. But fossil fuels have other advantages as well

Their _energy density_ is relatively high, meaning that these fuels contain a lot of energy per unit of volume and/or weight. A litre of petrol (gasoline) contains about 35 megajoules of energy. To put that into perspective, if a human would have to produce that amount of energy, (s)he would have to do physical exercise for about 35 hours straight.

Energy density is important as it makes the energy source easy to transport and carry around. For example, it takes only thirty litres of petrol to drive my Toyota Aygo for 600 kilometres. And kerosine is light enough that a plane can still take off, while it still provides enough energy to fly across half the world.

Another advantage of fossil fuels is that they are easy to transport in their solid, liquid and gaseous forms. A steel tank for liquids, a pipeline for gas and bulk containers for solid fuels are easy and cheap to produce.

But fossil fuels come with major disadvantages as well. To retrieve the energy from fossil fuels, we have to burn them. This emits large quantities of carbon dioxide, a gas that is the main cause of climate change. The world is also starting to run out of fossil fuels, making them more expensive.

#### New energy sources

To battle climate change and to ensure a steady supply of affordable energy, we need to move away from fossil fuels and transition towards a clean energy supply.

Most technologies that generate clean energy produce it in the form of electricity, such as wind turbines, solar panels and hydropower. And even [more controversial technologies such as nuclear energy, fusion energy or thorium](https://bartroossien.com/nuclear-energy-future-or-fiction-d985453c2b9f), produce energy in the form of electricity.

With clean energy mainly available as electricity, the demand side is shifting towards electrifying the energy systems. Petrol cars are replaced by electric cars. Gas or petrol fired heater boilers move towards heat pumps. And we even are developing electric aeroplanes.

TK “I love to plug in image”

However, electricity is a very difficult form of energy to manage. It is hard to store and not so easy to transport over long distances. Batteries for example have a low energy density and take a long time to charge. And electricity grids are expensive, have significant losses and are very limited in their transport capacity.

That is where hydrogen comes along.

### What is hydrogen fuel?

Hydrogen under atmospheric pressure and temperature is a gas with a high energy density. It contains over three times the amount of energy (120 MJ/kg) compared to petrol (44 MJ/kg). 

Hydrogen can be turned into a liquid form by compressing and cooling. Both liquid and gas forms of hydrogen can be transported (relatively) easy. A major advantage is that we already have a liquid and gas fuel infrastructure that can be adapted to transport hydrogen instead.

Hydrogen does not contain any carbon elements. If ignited, it does not emit any carbon dioxide, making it a potential clean energy source. Potential, because there are some caveats, but more about that later.

Similar to natural gas, hydrogen can be burned to generate high-temperature heat, used to heat buildings or in industrial processes.

But hydrogen can also be used as a fuel in a _fuel cell,_ which generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction. A fuel cell in an electric car only needs 5 kg of hydrogen to power it for over 600 km. And because hydrogen is a gas or liquid, the car is refuelled as fast as a petrol car.

Hydrogen is therefore seen as a great replacement for fossil fuels. But hydrogen does have some issues.

### Hydrogen production

As opposed to fossil fuels, wind or sunlight, hydrogen gas is not present on our planet. It cannot be mined or collected. Instead, it has to be made out of other sources.

Hydrogen is therefore not really a ‘fuel’ in the definition we know it from oil-based products. Instead, it is a form of energy storage, similar to a battery or a tank full of hot water.

The industry has been producing hydrogen for decades. It is an import component in the production of oil-based fuels, such as petrol and kerosene, and the production of fertilizers. The current hydrogen market is worth well over 100 billion dollars.

Over 95% of all hydrogen is produced by reforming natural gas. This process releases a lot of carbon dioxide. So while using hydrogen is carbon-free, the production of hydrogen is not. Hydrogen made from fossil fuels is called **grey hydrogen**.

#### Electrolysis

There is a different way of producing hydrogen. You may even have done it as an experiment in high school chemistry class. When two metal plates are immersed in water and electricity is put through them, the water molecules split up into pure hydrogen and pure oxygen. This process is called electrolysis.

But there is more to hydrogen.

#### Blue hydrogen

Because carbon dioxide emissions for hydrogen occurs during the production phase and not the use phase, it provides options for alternative production methods.

Current hydrogen producers that use natural gas as the source look at carbon capture and storage (CCS). In short, the carbon dioxide that is emitted during the production process is captured and than permanently stored underground in e.g. old natural gas wells.

This avoids the carbon dioxide of reaching our atmosphere and adding to global warming. Hydrogen that is produces with natural gas and CCS is called ‘blue hydrogen’.

While the idea has merit, it comes with numerous disadvantages:

*   CCS is still in its infancy
*   There are concerns about safety when large amount of carbon dioxide are stored underground.
*   CCS is an energy intensive process
*   Blue hydrogen still requires natural gas as a source, which is still a fossil fuel ans susceptible to [geopolitics](https://bartroossien.com/why-energy-transition-is-about-more-than-climate-change-610c3083cfbd).

[Recent scientific studies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956) are labeling blue hydrogen as even worse traditional forms of hydrogen production. Some see the push for blue hydrogen as an excuse from the ‘fossil fuel industry’ to continue their business as usual.

Productie en vraag naar waterstof is namelijk niet nieuw. De markt voor waterstof is op dit moment zo’n 120 miljard dollar per jaar groot. Het waterstof gaat grotendeels naar brandstofraffinage en kunstmestproductie. De prijs voor deze waterstof ligt op zo’n 80 dollarcent per kg (bron: Platts).

Bestaande proefprojecten hebben draagvlak nodig en hanteren (om woonlastenneutraal te blijven) geen marktconforme prijzen.

We zouden wel af kunnen gaan op (commerciële) waterstoftankstations voor auto’s. Zowel Toyota als Shell geven aan dat de prijs op dit moment op zo’n 10 euro per kg ligt. Of deze waterstof dan groen, blauw, grijs, geel, roze of rood is weet ik niet. 

Waterstof bevat per kg wel veel meer energie, dus even terugrekenen:  
Waterstof: 30 cent per kWh (10 euro per kg)  
Aardgas: 8 cent per kWh (80 eurocent per m3)  
Benzine: 14 cent per kWh (1,80 euro per liter)  
Elektriciteit: 21 cent per kWh
