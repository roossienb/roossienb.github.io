And what it has to do with orcs and elves.

TK something about retiring and how my plans are literally falling into the water (is that an English expression?)

#### Lord of the Rings

Around Christmas 2001, I was 18 years old and had just enrolled in university, I went to the movie theatre for that winter’s blockbuster, The Fellowship of the Ring. In between the fights among orcs, elves and dwarfs, I was stunned by the amazing views and landscapes. For eighteen year old me, it was unbelievable that such landscapes existed on this third rock from the sun.

New Zealand, where the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy was filmed, became a bucket list item. In 2018, this dream came true when I travelled for four weeks through the beautiful country of New Zealand, together with my wife, who happened to be originally from New Zealand.

#### Retirement

During our round trip, we particularly liked the city of Nelson, located on the northern part of the South Island and the nearby Abel Tasman National Park. We loved it so much that we totally could see ourselves living there permanently in the far future. 

Plans and possibilities were discussed and we saw opportunities for when we would (early) retire. As I’m turning 38 this year, that would take at least another 20 years. And that’s where the first cracks started to appear.

#### Sea level rise
