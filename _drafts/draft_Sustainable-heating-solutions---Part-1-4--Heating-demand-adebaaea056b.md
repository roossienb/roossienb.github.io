A TK significant part of buildings in the world is located in the [temperate zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate#/media/File:Latitude_zones.png). During the winter season, the outdoor temperature is significantly lower (< 10 °C) than the temperature humans feel comfortable with (19–22 °C). To keep buildings comfortable during wintertime, they are being heated.

Creating heat to make ourselves comfortable is not something new. [Over one million years ago, our ancestors used wood-fueled campfires to warm up their caves.](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/03/27/1117620109.abstract?sid=88fba9c9-4dad-40c3-be22-221676c4451b) 

In Europe, heating accounts on average for [70%](https://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/efficiency-by-sector/households/household-eu.pdf) of the total household energy demand (figure 1). In the United States it is on average [51%](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/homes.php). Overall, heating is a significant part of the total energy consumption of households in the temperate zone.

The demand for heating in a dwelling depends on two major factors:

*   The climate conditions at the location of the dwelling. The longer and harsher the winter is, the higher the heating demand
*   The insulation level of the dwelling. Better insulation of roofs, walls, floors windows and doors lead to significant reduction of heat demand, as the comfortable warmth inside the house is not lost (as much) to the outside.

  

### Heating systems

Heating systems are used to provide heat to keep the dwelling comfortable. Many heating systems today still use fossil fuels as their source. With approximately 45%, natural gas is by far the most used fuel, both in Europe and the United States.
