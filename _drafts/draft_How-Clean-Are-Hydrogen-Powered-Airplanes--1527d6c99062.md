Recently, ZeroAvia [announced](https://www.zeroavia.com/rotterdam) they aim to make their first commercial flight with a hydrogen-powered plane in 2024. The 19-seater plane will fly between Rotterdam The Hague airport (Netherlands) and London (United Kingdom). With hydrogen-powered planes, ZeroAvia claims to make air travel emission-free. But is that really possible?

### Dornier Do-228

ZeroAvia uses a converted Dornier Do-228 plane. This plane is known to have one of the lowest fuel consumption per flown kilometer in the world.

Rotterdam — London is a flight with a distance of 320 km. [The cruise speed of the Do-228 is 223 knots (412 km/h) with a fuel consumption of 660 pounds/hour (300 kg/hour)](http://jetav.com/fairchild-dornier-do-228-212-performance-specs/). 

For simplicity, I only consider the distance of the flight and neglect the take-off and landing part.

It takes 46 minutes for the Do-228 to fly from Rotterdam to London during which it consumes 233 kg of fuel.

The fuel used, kerosene, has [an energy density of 46.2 MJ/kg](https://neutrium.net/properties/specific-energy-and-energy-density-of-fuels/) and [produces 71.5 grams of CO2 per MJ when](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/CO2-spez/index_e.php) burned. 

**Thus, the total carbon dioxide that is emitted in one flight is 770 kg**.

### Hydrogen-powered plane

TK A conventional propeller plane works very much like your car engine. Fuel is burned, producing hot expanding gases, which are converted into mechanical energy to power the propeller.

TK In a hydrogen-powered plane, works differently from the conventional plane. The propeller is rotated by an electric motor instead of a mechanical shaft. Electricity for this motor is provided by a fuel cell. A fuel cell uses an electrochemical process, in which hydrogen (stored in fuel tanks) and oxygen (from the air inlet) combined produce electricity. The only by-product of this process is pure water. There are no carbon dioxide emissions.

TK A hydrogen-powered plane is an electric plane, but instead of a battery, a hydrogen fuel cell is used to provide the electricity.

Hydrogen isn’t something that is found in nature. It has to be produced. The current production method [for over 95% of all hydrogen produced is by steam methane reformation](https://4thgeneration.energy/life-cycles-emissions-of-hydrogen/). Basically, hydrogen is made out of natural gas, and this production process emits carbon dioxide.

So while the plane won’t emit any carbon dioxide during flight, the production of hydrogen itself does produce carbon dioxide.

So how much carbon dioxide (CO2) does a hydrogen-powered plane produce in comparison to a conventional plane?

#### Carbon dioxide

First, we need to know how much hydrogen the plane needs. [The efficiency of a conventional turboprop engine is about 40%](https://web.archive.org/web/20161124123017/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/propulsion/sfc.html).

A hydrogen-powered plane uses an electric motor to provide the mechanical energy. The [efficiency of an electric motor is over 90%](https://www.cmesrl.com/en/high-efficiency-motors-ie3/#tab-2-poles-ie3).

There are different types of fuel cells. PEMFC fuel cell technology is considered to be the most mobile. It is used in hydrogen cars and trucks. The energy efficiency of this [type of fuel cell is roughly 55%](https://www.californiahydrogen.org/wp-content/uploads/files/doe_fuelcell_factsheet.pdf). 

To store enough hydrogen in a fuel tank, it needs to be compressed. [Compression losses are estimated to be about 10%](https://irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Dec/IRENA_Green_hydrogen_cost_2020.pdf). 

This brings the total efficiency (from hydrogen to propellers) of a hydrogen-powered plane at 44.6%, only slightly higher than the turboprop engine.

With an an e[nergy density of 120 MJ/kg](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/storage.pdf) for hydrogen, the total amount of hydrogen needed to make the Rotterdam-London flight is 80 kg.

Praxair, a major producer of hydrogen out of natural gas, [calculates that a million standard cubic feet of hydrogen relates to 25 tons of carbon dioxide emissions](https://www.linde.com/-/media/linde/merger/documents/sustainable-development/praxair-co2-emissions-reduction-capture-white-paper-w-disclaimer-r1.pdf?la=en), or 9,83 kg of CO2 per kg hydrogen.

**Thus, the total carbon dioxide that is emitted in one flight is 786 kg**. That is about the same as for our conventional plane! So what is the benefit of a hydrogen plane?

### Green hydrogen

A frequent used argument is that hydrogen can be produced sustainable through electrolysis. Electrolysis is the reverse process of a fuel cell and requires electricity as input. If the electricity comes from renewable energy sources, the produced hydrogen is emission free. This is called green hydrogen. Thus green hydrogen has a carbon footprint of (almost) 0 kg/MJ.

A PEM electrolyser has an efficiency of about 75%. To produce 80 kg of hydrogen requires 3500 kWh in electricity. If we would produce this electricity with solar panels near Rotterdam or London, we would need about 10 panels of 350 Wp each. The total area these panels use are about 17 m2.

### Biofuel

Another way of making air travel more sustainable is the use of biofuels or more commonly referred to as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). [Blends of SAFs and conventional fuel are already being used today.](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/air-france-klm-completes-eight-hour-flight-powered-by-used-cooking-oil/) 

Most SAFs are made from used plant-based oils, such as cooking or frying oil. There is not nearly enough cooking oil to provide in sufficient biofuel for flights. SAFs need agricultural land to grow plants that are turned into the biofuel.

TK: jatropha also needs [4x more water](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/biomass-energy-resources/reference-biomass/facts-figures/potential-yields-of-biofuels-per-ha-pa/) per unit of energy than feedstock based biofuel

While efforts are underway to grow plants such as [jatropha](https://aviationbenefits.org/faqs/what-is-sustainable-aviation-fuel/), which can grow in difficult non-arable soil, most biofuels that are currently produced directly from plants such as corn, miscanthus, soye, sugar cane and palm oil. All of these directly compete with our food supply and some of these products are related to non-sustainable farming, such as the burning of tropical forests.

[Yields](https://www.greenfacts.org/en/biofuels/figtableboxes/biofuel-yields-countries.htm) of feedstock based biofuels differ at length. If we stick with one of the highest yielding crops, miscanthus, a yield of [225 GJ per hectare](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/biomass-energy-resources/reference-biomass/facts-figures/potential-yields-of-biofuels-per-ha-pa/) or 22.5 MJ per square meter is achievable.

For our conventional Do-225 plane, we would need around 470 m2 of land to provide the fuel for a single flight.
