In the recently published article on Climate Conscious, [Sam Nattress](https://medium.com/u/43c9db94f18c) discusses why just cutting carbon isn’t sufficient to make sustainable choices.

[**Why We Shouldn’t (Just) Cut Carbon to Make More Sustainable Choices**

He uses a vegan burger that claims to be 100% climate-neutral as an example. Sam reasons that other factors, such as water consumption and air pollution, are just as important for sustainability as carbon emissions. And that the vegan burger may not be as sustainable as advertised.

I asked Sam if he knew how sustainable the vegan burger was in comparison to a meat burger. While I agree with [his answer](https://medium.com/@nattress.sam/thats-a-good-question-c3e16d3c155f), he inspired me to find a more quantified answer.

So let’s look at the water consumption, air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions for a 150 g soy-based vegan burger and a 150 g beef burger.

### Water consumption

In a scientific paper, Ertug Ercin et. al. from the Dutch University of Twente [has quantified the water consumption for soy-based milk and soy-based burgers and compared them with their animal equivalent products](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1470160X11004110).

In Figure 1, the water consumption for a 150 g soy burger is compared to a 150 g beef burger from different locations around the world. The paper considers the water consumption for the soybeans, additional ingredients (such as bell peppers, onions, and carrots), and packaging.

The paper concludes that a soy burger consumes about 158 litres of water, while a beef burger of a similar size requires on average 2,350 litres. A beef burger requires 15 times more water than a vegan burger.

### Air Quality

A recent study by Nina et. al. from the University of Minnesota concluded that [agricultural activities, mainly through livestock, cause poor air quality that is responsible for about 16,000 deaths in the United States each year](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/20/e2013637118).

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__8MSlatPf__20aHPUGtGGp3g.png)

Of all deaths, about 80% are attributed to livestock, the remaining 20% to plant-based foods. While plant-based foods do contribute to air pollution, their contribution is significantly lower than that of livestock-based foods.

While it is difficult to attribute air pollution to our 150 g vegan and meat burger, the [article’s appendix](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2021/05/06/2013637118.DCSupplemental/pnas.2013637118.sapp.pdf) does provide mortality rates for plant-based and animal-based foods. A soy-meal and beef-meal have mortality rates of respectively 1.51E–8 and 6.05E-7 deaths per kg per year.

In other words, the mortality rate caused by air pollution is 40 times higher for a meat burger, than it is for a soy-based burger.

### Greenhouse gases

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the main cause of climate change. Carbon dioxide is the most talked-about gas (hence the term ‘carbon-free), but especially in livestock farming, another gas plays an important role: methane.

[The global warming potential](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf) of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide is usually expressed in “carbon dioxide equivalents”. [Methane has a global warming potential that is 28 times stronger than carbon dioxide](https://www.ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/ghgp/Global-Warming-Potential-Values%20%28Feb%2016%202016%29_1.pdf), meaning that every kg of methane emissions have the same effect on global warming as 28 kg of CO2 emissions.

Methane is generated by the digestion system of animals and released in significant quantities through manure and farts.

[Poore et. al. (2018)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987) have performed an extensive study on greenhouse gas emissions from food. In Figure 3, their findings of a select number of foods are shown, expressed in kilograms carbon dioxide equivalents per kilogram of food.

Our 150 g beef burger adds about 9 kg of CO2 equivalents, while our soy burger (tofu) adds about 0.5 kg of CO2 equivalents.

### Land Use

Figure 3 already takes into account the greenhouse gas impact from land use. Land, specifically fertile land, is a scarce commodity. Instead of using it for grass for cattle to graze on, or for production of feed stock (corn, soy and silage), it could be repurposed for forests and other nature reserves where flora and fauna can live.

Soy requires only 1.3 m2 compared to 119.5 m2 for beef, a factor of 91!. Poore et.al. states that if we all would go vegan, the total world land use for food production would reduce by 75% from 4 to 1 billion.

### Conclusion

Compared to a beef burger, a 150 g soy-based vegan burger produces 18 times fewer greenhouse gases, has 40 times lower air pollution mortality rate, uses 91 times less land and 15 times less water.

At all levels, a vegan burger is more sustainable than a beef burger.
