Quantification of CO2 emissions from flights, accommodations, food and local transportation of those who attend the conference.

Every year, we have a climate change conference where thousands of politicians, lobbyists, experts and journalists from almost all countries in the world, come together to discuss current and future policy on climate change issues such as global warming. Soon, the 26th conference takes place in Glasgow. When I originally wrote this article on the 30th of November, the 20th conference in Lima, Peru was about to start. The numbers haven’t changed much since then.

A recurring discussion in comments on internet blogs, fora and twitter is how much CO2 is emitted by holding this conference? It’s an interesting question, so let’s give it a shot to quantify it.

[Estimates](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.reeep.org/events/cop-20-lima) are that a climate conference involves about 15,000 people from 200 different countries. The conference takes 12 days, but most participants arrive earlier and depart later as negotiations can get stuck.

### Flights

Some delegates arrive by governmental or chartered planes, others on regular flights. Let’s assume each country sends 1 government aircraft with on average 15 people on board. This means a total of 3,000 people (200 x 15) arrive by governmental plane. The remaining 12,000 participants arrive by a regular flight. The average flight distance to Lima is about 11,000 km (7,500 km from the United States, 11,000 km from Europe, 19,000 km from Central Asia).

According to [myclimate.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/https://co2.myclimate.org/en/portfolios?calculation_id=149213 "CO2 calculator"), an economy class round trip (2 x 10,500 km) from Amsterdam to Lima emits 4 tons of CO2 per passenger. Thus, 12,000 participants arriving by regular flight, emit a total of 48 thousand tons of CO2.

The website [Conklin and Decker](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/https://www.conklindd.com/CDALibrary/CO2Calc.aspx "CO2 calculator") allow you to calculate the CO2 emissions for a specific plane type. There is a large variety of plane types used by governments. The United States Presidents [Air force One](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://jetphotos.net/viewphoto.php?id=7854074&nseq=10 "Air force one") uses a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, but many governments use smaller planes such as a Cessna Citation. Let’s assume that the governmental planes are all Gulfstream Vs, a large-sized business plane. An 11.000 km flight with a Gulfstream V yields 78 tons of CO2. Multiply that by 200 planes (one for each country), times 2 (round trip), yields 31 thousand tons of CO2.

The total amount of CO2 for all flights are estimated to be 79 thousand tons of CO2.

### Accommodation

All these people need a place to sleep and shower. Let’s assume there are no romantic couples in the delegation, so every participant has their own hotel room. This means 15,000 hotel rooms will be booked for a period of about 15 days.

I have no statistics on hotels in Peru, but the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.epa.org/ "EPA") has written a [report](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.epa.gov/chp/documents/hotel_casino_analysis.pdf "Hotel CO2 emissions") on CO2 emissions for hotels in North America. For upscale hotels, this is about 33.4 kg CO2 per night per room.

The total amount of CO2 for accommodation is estimated to be 7,500 tons of CO2.

### Other emission sources

According to the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-a-livable-future/_pdf/research/clf_reports/kim_neff_carbon_calculators.pdf), the average person’s diet contributes 7 kg of CO2 every day. The total amount of CO2 for meals is estimated to be 1,600 tons of CO2.

In 2009 in Copenhagen, there were about [1,200 limousines](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/07/copenhagen-limos-private-planes_n_383516.html). This does not include the extra cars and buses used by e.g. journalists. These limousines easily drive about 2,500 km during the conference. With 400 gCO2/km, this brings the total emissions for limousines are at 1,200 tons of CO2. I was not able to quantify emissions from other means of transport.

There are many other sources of CO2 emissions. A report of the [Greener Davos Initiative](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM12/WEF_AM12_GreenerDavosInitiative.pdf "Greener Davos Initiative") indicates most CO2 emissions for international meetings come from flights. We thus assume that other emissions that haven’t been covered yet are negligible.

### Conclusion

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__pQM1__3fQII4LYYPSH8QaMg.png)

With flights (79,000 tons), accommodation (7,500 tons), food (1,600 tons) and limousines (1,200 tons) CO2 emissions are quantified and the remainder neglected, the total CO2 emissions for a Climate change conference yields a total of about 90,000 tons of CO2.

To put this into a perspective, this equals the CO2 emissions that a city of Amsterdam emits in 1 week.
