A comparison in numbers.

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__hFa3trq1byNC1k5Z__VJH4g.jpeg)

The Netherlands is phasing out natural gas. 90% of all Dutch households use natural gas to create heat for space heating and domestic hot water, mainly by a direct natural gas-fired boiler. One alternative for heating with natural gas is district heating, where heat is generated at a central location and distributed through pipes below the streets.

A frequent discussion that pops up is whether district heating is more expensive for the consumer than a gas-fired boiler?

_All financial amounts mentioned in this article are based on tariffs set in April 2021 and include the Dutch VAT tariff of 21%._

### District heating

The [tariffs for district heating](https://www.acm.nl/nl/warmtetarieven) are regulated by the Dutch Authority for Consumer & Market. Some district heating companies opt to ask for lower tariffs usually, about 5% below the regulated tariff. In this article, I use regulated tariffs.

The yearly tariff consists of a fixed and variable part.

The fixed part consists of a connection fee for space heating and domestic hot water (€ 478.60), the rent for the heat interface unit (€ 125.50) and metering service (€ 26.83), bringing the total yearly fixed costs to € 630.73.

The variable tariff is € 25.51 per GJ of heat used for space heating and domestic hot water.

The total energy bill for heat can be expressed in a simple formula:

**\[Total cost in €\] = 630.73 + 25.51 x \[GJ of heat used\]**

### Natural gas-fired boiler

To convert heat usage in GJ to natural gas consumption in m³ some assumptions need to be made. Natural gas used in the Netherlands has [a higher heating value / gross calorific value of 35.17 MJ/m³](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/countrypictures/cp_netherlands.pdf). The efficiency of condensing gas-fired boilers average about 90%. One GJ of heat demand equals 31.6 m³ of natural gas consumption.

In the Netherlands, there is a free choice for contracting a utility company for natural gas. Therefore, prices vary by company. I have chosen an ‘average’ company (Eneco) in terms of pricing. Prices at other companies vary by +/- 5%.

Tariffs are € 0.827 per m³ of natural gas consumption and € 276.59 in fixed yearly costs for billing, administration and the grid connection.

Additionally, the boiler requires maintenance. District heating includes ‘full-service, i.e. if there is a problem a maintenance engineer will be there within 24 hours and the homeowner will not be incurred any costs. For boilers, there are f[ull-service contracts](https://www.feenstra.com/shop/onderhoud/cv-ketel-all-in-abonnement.html#21993=63629) that provide the same service and cost € 181 per year.

The technical lifetime of a gas-fired boiler is about 15 years. The replacement costs in the Netherlands lie between [€ 1.000 and € 2.600](https://www.cvketel-weetjes.nl/kosten-cv-ketel/). I recently had mine replaced for € 1.800, including installation. To fund this replacement investment, € 120 a year should be reserved.

This brings the total costs for heat provided by a gas-fired boiler at:

**\[Total cost in €\] = 577.59 + 26.13 x \[GJ of heat used\]**

### Comparison

So what is cheaper? Well, that depends on the amount of heat you need. The heat demand (space heating + domestic hot water) for an average Dutch house is about 44 GJ. The gas boiler has a total yearly cost of € 1.727 and district heating € 1.753. The gas-fired boiler is cheaper, with a mere 2%.

An energy-efficient house requires about 15 GJ, bringing the total yearly cost at respectively € 969 and € 1.013. Again, the gas-fired boiler is cheaper by about 5%.

If the heat demand exceeds 86.2 GJ, only then is district heating cheaper than a gas-fired boiler.

But the differences are small and numbers can fluctuate. Some district heating companies have tariffs that are 5 to 10% lower than regulated tariffs. Similarly, the cost for natural gas and gas-fired boilers differ per supplier. For example, I don’t have a full-service contract for my boiler and save at least 50% on maintenance.

So overall, the yearly cost of ownership for district heating is roughly the same as that of district heating. But there is a catch.

### Initial connection costs

An important difference between natural gas and district heating is the initial cost to get a building connected to the infrastructure. For natural gas, this is a fixed, regulated amount of € 940,78. For district heating, it is maximised at € 4,878.04.

Adding these numbers to the above comparison is difficult. They are a one-time cost. Only a new built or an existing house that is converted from natural gas to district heating are confronted with these upfront costs.

One method to include these initial costs in the yearly cost of ownership is to annuitize the amount over the technical lifetime of the infrastructure (50 years) with an interest percentage of 3% (this percentage is considered to be acceptable for infrastructure costs by the national government).

This brings the yearly annuity to € 36,54 for natural gas and € 189,59 for district heating.

At 44 GJ heat demand, the yearly costs of ownership, including the initial costs, are € 1,764 and € 1,942 for gas-fired boiler respectively district heating.

Including initial connection, make district heating about 10% more expensive than a gas-fired boiler.

### Afterthoughts

District heating is an alternative for a gas-fired boiler, but it is not a _better_ alternative when it comes to costs.

But there are game-changers, such as sustainable and waste heat sources that provide lower temperature heat, found in e.g. data centres, effluent from sewage and surface water. Furthermore, district heating solutions are redesigned such that they can also provide district cooling. These [fifth-generation district heating and cooling](https://5gdhc.eu/) provide more and sustainable comfort at affordable prices.
