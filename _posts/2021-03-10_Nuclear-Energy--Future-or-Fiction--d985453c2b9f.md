Will nuclear energy power the transition towards a sustainable energy supply, or is it a foolish hope?

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\0__zCL8EEjKm07nhL1M.jpg)

Nuclear energy must be one of the most controversial topics present when it comes to our energy supply. Proponents believe that nuclear energy is the key to a low-carbon energy supply while opponents see unsolvable barriers in nuclear waste, cost and security.

Nuclear energy saw large scale adoption in the 1970s and 1980s and nowadays accounts for approximately 10% of our worldwide electricity demand through around 435 operational reactors. After the meltdown of reactor number 4 in Chernobyl in 1986, nuclear power gained resistance from society and the build of new reactors slowed down. The average age of the remaining operational reactors is 31 years.

Following the Fukushima Daiichi incident in 2011, the fear of nuclear power was reinforced. Germany even decided to shut down all their nuclear reactors shortly after that, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions as the nuclear power plant were replaced by coal-fired plants. More recently, [there are calls in Japan for closing all its nuclear power plants](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210302/p2g/00m/0na/022000c). Fukushima also learned us that we can respond to a nuclear disaster. A recent UN research report states that [radiation did not damage the health of the local people](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/10/fukushima-meltdown-did-not-damage-health-un-japan).

Proponents of nuclear energy have been steadily gaining ground in the past few years. [Bill Gates recently said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/bill-gates-nuclear-power-will-absolutely-be-politically-acceptable.html) he believes that nuclear power will be politically acceptable again. And he is not wrong. In the [upcoming Dutch elections nuclear energy is provided as an alternative to wind and solar energy](https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/03/nuclear-power-is-back-on-the-political-agenda-with-a-right-left-divide/) as a solution towards (near) carbon-free energy supply, mainly by parties on the right side of the political spectrum.

One contributing factor in the adoption of nuclear energy as a low-carbon solution is the increasing resistance against (large scale) solar and wind energy initiatives. These initiatives change the landscapes visibly. Proponents of nuclear energy say that it can provide low-carbon electricity while requiring little space.

But is nuclear power really the solution for the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon energy supply?

### Cost

A major barrier to nuclear energy nowadays is the cost. [The OECD projected in 2015 that the costs for nuclear power](http://www.oecd.org/publications/cost-benchmarking-for-nuclear-power-plant-decommissioning-acae0e3b-en.htm) are between 50 $/MWh and 125 $/MWh. The UK nuclear reactor Hinkley point C, subsidized by the UK government but operated by the commercial energy company EDF, currently has a strike price of 104 $/MWh.

The long-term futures base-load price on the European electricity market currently trades for about 53 $/MWh.

Large-scale solar and wind have almost competitive prices in North-west Europe (between 50 and 70 $/MWh), but the world cheapest [solar park in Abu Dhabi costs less than 14 $/MWh](https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-world-just-set-a-record-for-the-cheapest-solar-farm-1843163060).

However, nuclear is difficult to compare to solar and wind energy. The latter are intermittent, they do not follow the demand in energy. It will require additional systems, such as storage, backup generators and/or demand response to provide reliable electricity. A nuclear power plant runs (almost) 24/7 year-round and is perfect for providing a baseload. System costs for intermittent sources are significantly higher than for nuclear.

Still, nuclear power doesn’t really price competitive in the current market.

### Commercial vs government

The largest costs in the nuclear energy price are the capital expenses of a nuclear power plant. Hickley Point C for example is currently estimated to cost 25 billion pounds, well over 10.000 $/MW. Modern coal-fired power plants cost around 4.000 $/MW, while solar and wind are below 1000 $/MW, although their yield per unit of power is lower too.

The investments to cover the capital expenses are paid back over the economic life of 50 years, with interest. Commercial investors would want to cover the risks involved and therefore demanding high interest rates. Plus, commercial operators aim for profit. This easily leads to a discount rate of 10%, resulting in a levelized cost of well over 100 $/MWh.

Governments can borrow money relatively cheaply and as they have no profit goal, discount rates are a lot lower, as low as 3%. This makes nuclear energy a lot more affordable, bringing it in the 50–75 $/MWh range.

That does however require that governments initiate, invest and carry the risks of nuclear power plants. In liberalized energy markets such as the UK or The Netherlands, this may be hard to realize. It will also require public support, as election votes are at play.

In Sweden, the opposite is currently happening. While the government considers nuclear energy a dead end, [78% of Swedes support the use of nuclear energy](https://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Swedish-support-for-nuclear-continues-to-grow,-pol).

However, building a nuclear power plant is a choice made for 50 years, while governments usually don’t last more than 5. A change in political direction may risk a change of vision on nuclear energy, and with that costly, regrettable decisions.

### Uranium supply

The supply of uranium is not unlimited. It is estimated that there is enough uranium [to last for 230 years given our current consumption](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/), providing us with 10% of worldwide electricity demand. If we decarbonize the base-load (about 50%) of the current worldwide electricity demand, we would only last 46 years. That is less than the lifetime of a nuclear reactor. This does not include the electrification of transportation and heating, increasing the demand for low-carbon electric production. If we go full nuclear, we may be running out within 20 years.

There is a supply of uranium that has been untouched so far. About 4.5 billion metric tons of uranium could be extracted from seawater. That is 30.000 times more than current uranium resources on the land. To unleash this potential uranium supply, significant funding for research, development, and prototyping is needed as well as investment in ‘mining’ stations.

This will add up to the operational costs of a nuclear power plant, pushing the MWh price up.

### Waste disposal

The expended fuel rods are highly radioactive, sometimes up to several 1,000 years and no real solution is yet available. Radioactive waste is commonly [vitrified in glass and then stored near-surface or deep underground.](https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/nuclear-waste-pilesscientists-seek-best/98/i12)

While vitrification is a proven technology, the optimal glass composition is still been researched.

There is also little known about the lifetime of the glass. Groundwater may interact or corrode the glass. Leaks could result in high radioactive material seeping into drink water reserves with unforeseen consequences.

Safe, long term storage, or other ways of disposal of nuclear waste, will require significant research budgets, increasing the price of nuclear energy.

### Waste heat

The conversion efficiency from heat generated by fuel rods to electricity is roughly 40%. The remaining heat is cooled away. About 40% of the total heat produced, but not used, could be utilized by distributing it through a heating grid. This untapped heat source would provide several benefits.

It provides a direct low-carbon heat source for industry, horticulture and/or residential heating demand. It takes away the need to electrify current fossil fuel-powered heating systems, such as gas-fired boilers. Therefore, it avoids an increase in electricity consumption, while also decarbonizing the heating supply.

As a result, it generates additional income. Wholesale heat in district heating has a value of roughly 5 to 10 $/GJ or 18 to 36 $/MWh. That is a significant amount that could make a nuclear power plant financially more viable.

It does require the nuclear power plant to be near an area with a dense heat demand, as transportation of heat is expensive and limited in range. The presence of a nuclear power plant in nearby densely populated areas, however, may expect significant resistance from society.

### Climate change

But will nuclear power have a significant impact on reducing climate change? The unfortunate answer to that is no.

The development of a new nuclear power plant takes 5 to 10 years. Even if today we would decide to start building significant amounts of nuclear power plants, they will only start contributing to decarbonizing our energy supply around 2035.

To stay below the global warming targets of 1.5 °C (minor climate change impact) and 2 °C (moderate climate change impact), the [remaining carbon budget was 420 gigaton respectively 1,170 gigaton at the start of 2018](https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html). With emissions reaching 42 gigaton/year, our budget would be exhausted by 2028 respectively 2045. Taking into account that it is expected that worldwide carbon-free by 2050 is ambitious, measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions need to be taken fast and cannot wait until 2035.

**\[Update April 2021\]** A recent story by [Krista Kurth Ph.D.](https://medium.com/u/6063b8cab7d0) explaining [different roadmaps to carbon dioxide emission reduction](https://medium.com/climate-conscious/how-does-the-world-get-to-net-zero-before-2050-1874faaa6504) makes this even more clear. The ‘Halving Emissions Each Decade’ roadmap demonstrates that the world can stay below the target of 1.5 °C global warming if carbon dioxide emissions are halved every decade. In 2030 only 50% of emissions in 2020 are remaining, in 2040 50% of emissions in 2030 are remaining (and 25% of 2020) etc.

If nuclear power plant construction starts today, the earliest that they would start operating is between 2030 and 2035. At that point, the world already has realized between 50% and 70% of carbon dioxide emission reductions.

Consider how our energy supply would look if 70% of our 2020 carbon dioxide emission have been reduced. Would we need nuclear energy for the last 30% at that point or will other technologies suffice?

### What about Thorium and Fusion?

While both thorium powered molten salt reactors (MSR) and fusion reactors are frequently mentioned as safer and cleaner sources for nuclear power, neither technology is near market-ready.

The experimental fusion reactor ITER, currently being built in Cadarache, France, suffers from major technical challenges, postponing its original commission from 2016 to beyond 2026. The earliest we would be able to expect commercial fusion reactors would be after 2050.

Although the first reactor experiments with thorium date from the 1960s, progress has mainly been made at a small scale level. Like fusion, thorium still has [significant challenges](https://www.thmsr.com/en/challenges/) to overcome. These include the use of a non-toxic fuel, the start-up sequence (for which currently uranium or plutonium is needed) and the creation of Uranium-233 in the fuel waste, which can be used in nuclear weapons. Like fusion, commercial exploitation is not expected before 2050.

Both thorium and fusion have promising long term prospects but are unable to play any part in the decarbonization of our energy supply in the next 30 years.

### So, fiction or future?

Nuclear power, while still controversial, is a viable technology to provide low-carbon electricity. It can provide a long term, continuous reliable supply of electricity that can provide baseload power.

Costs will be a significant challenge. This can be partially tackled by government-owned power plants, as opposed to commercial power plants. Still, the development of a steady uranium supply from seawater and safe disposal of nuclear waste will push the price up.

The taboo around nuclear energy must be broken. Governments should be able to openly talk about it and provide funding for research of uranium supply, waste disposal and cheap(er) innovative reactors.

However, nuclear power arrives too late to turn the tide in our fight against global warming. Other technologies have to step up this decade to significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

Nuclear energy may have a future in the long term, but it is foolish to hope that it will contribute to our short term challenges around climate change and decarbonizing our energy supply.
