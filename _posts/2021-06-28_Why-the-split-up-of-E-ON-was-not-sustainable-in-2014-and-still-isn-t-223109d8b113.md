Society is getting the bill for the closure of coal-fired and nuclear power plants.

Germans largest energy utility company, E-ON, [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/01/us-e-on-divestiture-idUSKCN0JE0WJ20141201) in 2014 that it splits its conventional power activities and shift its focus on renewable energy. At first glance, it was a brave move, but not so sustainable as E-ON tried to let us believe.

It’s no secret that large European utility companies are suffering major losses due to their devaluation of fossil fuel generation assets. Electricity prices on the wholesale market have dropped over 30% between 2010 and 2014. The rise of renewable energy with near-zero marginal costs has pushed ‘dirty energy’ out of the market, especially in Germany.

Furthermore, interconnectivity among European markets (EPEX) has flattened the price profile, resulting in a lower average price and lower margins.

The period 2008–2014 was still characterized by large investments in fossil fuel plants, leading to an abundance in production capacity. For example, the Netherlands had 29 GW of capacity available in 2014, while its yearly peak demand barely reached half of that.

Just before the split up, E-ON had invested in cleaner combined cycle gas power plants (CCPP). These have about 50% less carbon dioxide emissions than a coal-fired power plant. CCPP never really got a foothold in Europe. In the Netherlands Eneco & Dong dismantled and sold the most efficient CCPP in Europe (Enecogen, 60.2% efficiency) right after it was commissioned in 2012, as it was not profitable to operate.

In its [2013 Annual Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20141220011524/http://www.eon.com/en/about-us/publications/annual-report.html), E-ON blames the failure of CCPP on low prices of carbon dioxide in the European Emission Trading System, thus not rewarding cleaner fossil solutions. E-ON fails to mention that coal prices had dropped due to oversupply from the US, while gas prices remained relatively high. A development that seemingly has been undervalued in E-ONs risk assessments.

Like many utility companies in Europe, E-ON lobbied for a regulated framework to allow conventional power plants to operate economically feasible for the power supply to remain reliable. This is based on a vision that conventional generation is always there when intermittent renewable sources, such as solar and wind energy, fail to deliver. Basically, utilities ask a balancing market where conventional generators are preferred and subsidized over any other balance form.

However, in the past 15 years, new balancing technologies have emerged, such as demand response (smart grids) and cheap energy storage. A vision in which conventional generation serves as a backup for renewable energy is outdated.

E-ON was under the pressure of 33 billion euros of debt, closing its nuclear power plants in Germany by 2022 and an energy transition it was not prepared for.

The decision to split the company in two, a parent company focusing on renewable energy and a spin-off (named Uniper) with all fossil assets. Although E-ON shareholders received the news enthusiastically (+6.3% stock), it was still a question of who is going to (re-) finance this spin-off. Initially, E-ON and its direct shareholders got ownership of the company.

Eventually, around 75% of shares were bought by Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum Oyj. For a company that nationally focuses on clean energy, an unusual buy that has not gone unnoticed. The activist group Extinction Rebellion has [accused](https://elokapina.fi/en/news/press-release/2021/04/28/fortumin-viherpesu/) Fortum of greenwashing because as they have been upscaling their fossil fuel activities.

During the financial crisis, banks and financial organizations suffered from a similar problem. Their high-risk derivatives, such as mortgages, were such a pressure on the continuity that governments offered bail-outs: the high-risk loans were housed in a spin-off and refinanced, usually with taxpayers money, allowing the parent company to continue to operate. Whether these ‘bad banks’ will ever be profitable is questionable. It’s not unlikely that the taxpayer will eventually pay the bill of the risks that others have taken. E-ONs decision to house its fossil-based operations in a new company looks like a ‘bad bank’ move.

One would expect that Uniper was a good buy for Fortum. The [financial statements](https://ir.uniper.energy/download/companies/uniperag/Annual%20Reports/2021-03-04_FY2020_Uniper_Group_Annual_Report_en.pdf) sketch a different story. Its revenue declined from 70 billion euro’s in 2016 to 50 billion euro’s in 2020. Its net losses were significant in 2016 and 2017 and since 2018 it has been barely profitable.

> Uniper is E-ONs ‘bad bank’.

And Fortum knows this. Fortum has however increased its dividend payout in the last few years. In 2020, Uniper paid half a billion in dividends to its shareholders.

Fortum is trying to get as much money out of Uniper as possible. And once the Uniper cow has been milked completely dry, it is disposed of by bankrupting it. The clean-up of all the power plants will be for society.

This is not speculating. Uniper is [planning to shed its coal assets in favour of gas activities as part of the clean energy program of Fortum](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4395508-fortum-strategy-update-and-considerations-gas). But the financial retribute remains unclear.

In the Netherlands, [Uniper is demanding major compensation from the government](https://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/economie/10442631/forsere-compensatie-nodig-bij-uitfasering-kolen) for the planned closure of its coal-fired power plant.

In 2014, E-ON chose a solution that benefitted its shareholders until the last day of its existence while sending a huge toxic and radioactive bill to the European society.

When I originally wrote the article in 2014, I ended the article with the phrase “I don’t think this is what Hermann Scheer meant when he told Germany about his sustainable energy vision.”

When I recovered and re-edited my original article, I started to realize that my prediction in 2014 about Uniper was completely right. The bill for leaving fossil fuel will not be paid by the shareholders that profited from it, but by society. It is time we hold shareholders accountable for the environmental cost of their profit and send them the bill.
