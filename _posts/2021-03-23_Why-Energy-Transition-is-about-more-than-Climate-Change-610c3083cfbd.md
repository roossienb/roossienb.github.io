And how a secret Dutch-Russian natural gas deal explains why fossil fuels break diplomatic morals.

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\0____asA0QNkUai5__yn7.jpg)

In July 2014, Malaysian flight MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur suddenly disappeared from the radar. [Its debris was soon found in Eastern Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28357880) and all 283 passengers and 15 crew perished. While rumours already talked about Russian involvement, it was until four years later, when a Joint Investigation Team, led by the Netherlands and Australia, concluded that it was Quickly, rumours popped up that it was a Russian operated BUK surface-to-air missile that caused the demise of flight MH17 and that [Russia was being held responsible](https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2018/05/25/mh17-the-netherlands-and-australia-hold-russia-responsible).

Europe imposed economic sanctions on Russia and demanded the four operators of the BUK missile to be put on trial in the International Court in The Hague. Diplomatic relations between Europe, and in particular The Netherlands, and Russia went sour.

Today, journalist investigation platform Follow The Money published an article stating that [while publicly The Netherlands froze diplomatic and trade relations with Russia, behind closed doors it was securing its natural gas deals](https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/mh17-was-no-obstacle-to-gas-talks-with-putin-they-just-had-to-be-carried-out-secretly). A deal not only hidden from public eyes but also from parliament.

### The natural gas interdependence

And while diplomatically this deal comes as a shock, it is completely rational. Europe’s demand for natural gas is higher than its own natural gas fields can provide. Most natural gas fields in the North Sea are reaching their end of life, reducing output.

Land-based extraction has become more controversial. The natural gas fields in the Dutch Province of Groningen, [are being decommissioned](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-gas-idUSKCN1VV1KE), after field depletion is causing the ground to collapse, with destructive earthquakes damaging up to 100,000 houses in the region. The cost for reparation, if possible, is currently a political minefield.

While this has resulted in The Netherlands taking action to decrease its dependency on natural gas, other European countries, such as Germany, are using natural gas as a replacement for their dirty ligate (‘brown coal’) fueled power plants.

The demand for natural gas inside Europe is increasing. Imports from Russia have [increased by 40% in the past five years](https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russian-gas-increasingly-important-europe).

Russia on the other hand has an [economy that drives on the export of fossil fuels, mainly to Europe](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/rus/) in which The Netherlands is one of their most important trade partners. A recent analysis of the Russian natural gas expansion concluded that Europe [will remain an important trade partner](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X2030064X) for the next decade as other export markets are difficult to unlock.

And as such, Europe needs Russia and Russia needs Europe. Their diplomatic and trade relations are very much interdependent as a result of fossil fuels. Despite The Netherlands and Russia officially froze their relations after the MH17 incident.

### Energy transition fights more than climate change

Meanwhile, an energy transition has been set in motion to reduce the worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide to combat global warming. A transition towards a clean, sustainable and affordable energy supply.

Many solutions in the energy transition are decentralized as sources of sustainable energy can be found locally, such as solar, wind and water. There is no need for natural gas from Russia, oil from Saudi Arabia or coal from Australia if the energy you need can be harvested with solar panels on your roof, a wind turbine in your garden, wave energy along the coast and hydropower in rivers.

Countries that found themselves lucky with large supplies of fossil fuels have become rich and powerful. They are getting away with morally questionable behaviour such as [violation of human rights](https://japantoday.com/category/sports/amnesty-calls-on-fifa-to-press-qatar-on-worker-rights) and international laws. And with the dependence on fossil fuels, the rest of the world can only watch and swallow their critique.

But not for long as with the energy transition comes _energy independence_. Countries will no longer depend on others for their energy supply and no longer have to commit to morally questionable diplomatic actions and secret trade deals.
