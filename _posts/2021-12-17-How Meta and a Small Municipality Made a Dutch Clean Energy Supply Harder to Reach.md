title: How Meta and a Small Municipality Made a Dutch Clean Energy Supply Harder to Reach

Yesterday evening, the Council of Zeewolde, a municipality of 22,000 people, voted in favour of building the largest data centre The Netherlands has ever seen. A controversial vote that had proponents and opponents having heated discussions in the past few months.

The Netherlands is now left with the question of whether this hyper-scale data centre will contribute to the Dutch economy, employment and sustainable energy supply.

This hyper-scale data centre, owned and exploited by Facebook’s mother company Meta, measures 166 hectares (410 acres). Its electric power consumption is estimated to be between 120 and 200 MW. The result is an energy consumption of 1.3 billion kWh per year. That is **1.2% of the total Dutch electricity demand**.

And Meta cannot be blamed. The Netherlands has an excellent infrastructure. AMS-IX, one of the largest internet nodes in the world, is a mere 50 kilometres away. The Dutch electricity infrastructure belongs to the top 5 most reliable in the world. Our roads are only rivalled by the German ones. And electricity at these levels of consumption is barely taxed.

This infrastructure has been paid for by the Dutch taxpayer. And is questionable whether Meta will contribute their share to the Dutch economy. Hyper-scale data centres require very few jobs and Meta will pay almost no taxes in The Netherlands.

Worse, even if Meta would cover the data-centre completely in solar panels, it would only provide 4% of its demand. Current plans are aiming at less than a third of those number of panels.

To cover its energy demand, over 100 wind turbines at sea are needed, which will have to be financed by the Dutch to meet their carbon-emission targets within the European Union. Wind turbines could have been used to make Dutch households more sustainable.

Worse, Dutch grid capacity is at its limit. Grid companies have to disappoint newly built industry and utility buildings because there is insufficient grid capacity to connect them. However, a former minister of economic affairs — when he was still minister — prioritized the connection on the high voltage grid under pressure from Meta, despite the objections from his officials and the Secretary of State.

An argument used is that Meta is building and financing its own substation and then opening it up for use to other industries nearby. A substation that needed to be built anyways and if built by the grid company, the costs would have been billed to Meta nonetheless.

An important reason why even the local green party, against its own national policy, is voting in favour, is because of waste heat. There are plans to use the waste heat from the data centre in the nearby villages of Zeewolde and Harderwijk. Both villages already have buildings connected to a district heating grid and are supplied with a sustainable heat source.

Expansion of this district heating grid could provide the opportunity for Meta’s data centre to provide waste heat. But Even if Meta would do so, it will take years before the planning, engineering and realisation of the pipeline are complete. And it won’t be even close to the 200 MW of waste heat that is being generated.

The elephant in the room that is not being addressed is why a local small municipality is left to take such a major decision, that impacts the Dutch national energy policy. The simple reason: **there is no national vision** on the settling of hyper-scale data-centres or large industries in general.

These industries come here for our excellent infrastructure and low taxes but offer little in return. A national vision and policy could set terms. Because let’s get one thing straight, as long as Meta’s applications are still growing, it needs to build more data centres. And putting them ‘somewhere else’ is a not-in-my-backyard response that helps no one.

Instead, the Dutch government could have set terms, like having Meta invest in green energy, equal to the amounts it consumes. It could tax proportionally for use of our infrastructures. And have it pay a commercial price for land use, instead of the 75 million discount it got.

The Netherlands is now 1.3% further away from having a green and sustainable energy supply.
