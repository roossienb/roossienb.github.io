And avoid getting a $17,000 energy bill.

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\0__j3x__2tJBp0Su2J5Z.jpg)

In February of this year, Texas was hit with one of the worst colds it ever experienced. The cold was so extreme, that [some fossil fuel power plants could no longer operate](https://tidalsoundings.medium.com/the-great-texas-freeze-out-8bac6b466b17). And while electricity supply availability plummeted, the demand spiked as people tried to keep their houses warm with electric heating. As a result [spot prices soared from $22 per MWh to over $9.000 per MWh](https://marker.medium.com/the-price-of-electricity-in-texas-maxed-out-this-week-9835589eb0c0), pushing the energy bill of people with a variable rate plan to up to $17.000.

This wasn’t the first event in which consumers with variable-rate plans were faced with immense energy bills.

In October 2018, [customers of the New Zealand energy company Flick Energy saw prices of their variable-rate plan](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/108121941/heat-goes-on-spotprice-power-customers-as-wholesale-prices-soar) sharply increase. Low water levels in hydro-power plants in combination with a malfunctioning natural gas pipe feeding a gas-fired power plant, caused spot prices to tenfold.

More often, energy companies offer variable pricing plans as alternatives to traditional fixed-price plans. They promise that customers buy straight from the spot market and profit from low prices. But what if the prices don’t drop, but sharply increase, like in New Zealand and Texas?

Are variable pricing plans any good for small consumers, or should they find themselves a quick death to prevent unexpected energy bills?

### Fixed vs variable pricing plans

To understand the risks involved with variable pricing plans, we first have to understand how electricity pricing works.

Electricity consumption is measured in kWh (pronounce: kilo-watt-hour), a physical measure of energy. If you own or rent a house, you probably have a contract with an energy company. In this contract, it is agreed on the price you pay per kWh of electricity consumption.

A typical price in the US is about 0.15 $/kWh, while Europe has prices around 0.20–0.35 $/kWh, mainly due to higher taxes and environmental fees.

A part of this price (usually in the range of 0.04–0.08 $/kWh) is the cost of purchasing the electricity from a supplier, the rest of the contracted price consists of administration fees, taxes, and infrastructural costs.

The purchase price varies hourly (but more on that later). In a fixed price plan, you are charged with one purchase price during the length of the contract. Your energy company deals with the variations.

But in a variable pricing plan, the energy company charges you the variable purchasing price that is set on the spot market.

### Spot market

So what is the spot market you wonder? Electricity is traded like many other commodities, through a competitive market for demand and supply.

Let’s take an analogy using potatoes. Bill, Jenny, and Frank each want to buy 100 kg of potatoes. The total demand for potatoes is 300 kg. Four farms can sell potatoes:

+-----------+--------+-----------+  
| Farm Name | Amount |   Price   |  
+-----------+--------+-----------+  
| Idaho     | 150 kg | 0.80 $/kg |  
| Alberta   |  90 kg | 0.95 $/kg |  
| Dakota    |  80 kg | 1.10 $/kg |  
| Quebec    | 190 kg | 1.40 $/kg |  
+-----------+--------+-----------+

Now Jenny could go to Alberta to get her potatoes. But if Alberta knows that people have to buy from Dakota due to demand, it could match its sale price. Similarly, if Jenny knows that Idaho is cheaper than Alberta, she will demand a lower price.

A third party, called a market clearinghouse, is the solution. Suppliers tell the clearinghouse how much potatoes they want to sell and what their _minimum_ price is. Buyers tell the clearinghouse how much they want to buy and what their maximum price is.

As Bill, Jenny, and Frank have to eat, they will have to buy at any price.

The clearinghouse fulfils the demand orders starting with the supplier with the lowest price: Idaho provides Bill with 100 kg and Jenny with 50 kg. Alberta then provides 50 kg to Jenny and 40 kg to Frank. Dakota provides the remaining demand of 60 kg to Frank. Dakota is left with 20 kg and Quebec hasn’t sold anything.

The clearing price that is paid for the potatoes, is the price of the last supplier that fulfils a contract, in this case, Dakota. Bill, Jenny, and Frank all have to pay 1.10 $/kg, and Idaho, Alberta, and Dakota all receive 1.10 $/kg.

The electricity spot market works exactly like this: the cheaper forms of electricity, such as renewables, come first followed by more expensive types of generation, such as natural gas-fired power plants.

The market supply is visualized in what is called a **Merit order.** Each power plant is represented by a bar, representing the marginal price for electricity production (height) and the maximum power or energy it can provide (width).

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__AzUMyfRTiceF__zopQlu25Q.png)

To determine the market price, the demanded power is drawn on the horizontal axis. At this point, power demand equals power supply. The demand line cuts the bar of one of the power plants. The minimum price of this power plant is the price for the entire market. This is the spot price, the price that all buyers have to pay and all sellers left of the demand line receive.

### Price variability

The price of the spot market varies in time. In most countries, electricity on the spot market (the ‘day-ahead market’) is traded hourly. Every hour, a price is determined by the amount of supply offered and demand requested for that hour.

Take for example the spot price for the Netherlands on April 6th, 2021 in the image below. During the night, prices drop below 20 $/MWh (= 0.02 $/kWh) but by 8 a.m. it has risen to over 90 $/MWh while in the afternoon it drops back to 20 $/MWh.

Currently, the purchasing price in a fixed-price contract with a Dutch energy company is about 66 $/MWh (= 0.066 $/kWh).

So where is this variability coming from? Let’s got back to our potatoes. What if Alberta would have lost their entire crop to a disease? Not only would Dakota sell all its potatoes, but even Quebec is now selling. And as Quebec is the most expensive seller, the clearing price has now gone up!. All farmers receive Quebec’s price and all buyers need to pay this higher price.

Or what if a new farm came to the market: Greenland offering 130 kg of potatoes for a mere 0.50 $/kg? Dakota would no longer sell any potatoes and Alberta is setting the clearing price now.

Demand can also change. If Jenny no longer needs potatoes, or if a new customer comes on the market, prices may go down or up.

The electricity spot price market works exactly like that. Electricity demand is usually higher during the day, especially in the early evenings.

Additionally, a spring storm crossing the Netherlands on April 6th providing an abundance of wind energy, pushing spot prices down.

### Benefiting from low prices is hard

Prices are low as electricity demand is low (off-peak hours) and when there is a surplus in cheap, renewable energy available.

A variable price plan offers the opportunity to benefit from these low prices. If you are charged hourly against the spot price, you could turn on the dishwasher and laundry machine at night and refill your electric boiler at 2 p.m., while trying to use as little electricity as possible between 6 and 9 a.m.

This is not as easy as it sounds. You don’t want to get up at 2 a.m. to turn the dishwasher on. And missing out on that delicious slice of toast with a hot cup of tea at breakfast is unacceptable.

It turns out that when you need electricity, everyone else in your neighbourhood also needs that electricity. Our lives are very cyclic: we all get up at the same time, go to work at the same time and come home to make supper at the same time. When our solar panels provide the most power at noon, we are not at home and when wind turbines are rotating in the night, we are asleep.

Getting those low prices is hard work. It requires us to change our daily habits. And for what? To save maybe $20 a month on your energy bill at best? There are easier ways to save money on energy (hint: energy efficiency, but that is for a future topic).

### But mitigating risks is even harder…

Paying spot prices also comes with a risk: that of having to pay top-dollar prices when you have demand for electricity that cannot be postponed. And while prices are unlikely to drop below 0 $/MWh (I know this is not entirely true at the moment due to subsidized renewable energy), prices can go up almost infinitely as Texas demonstrated with a whopping 9,000 $/MWh.

But even the more moderately 250 $/MWh that New Zealand saw in 2018 could wipe out your entire profit from low pricing within hours.

Mitigating this risk is very difficult for the consumer. It isn’t much you can do about it. Solutions can be found in energy storage such as a Tesla Powerwall, but at $10,000 are not cheap.

n energy company, however, has an easy time mitigating this risk. as it operates very differently. It doesn’t buy all its electricity on the spot market. Only about 15 to 25 percent of all electricity is traded on the spot market. The rest is traded on the **futures market.** Here the energy company can contract suppliers months or even years in advance.

At a later time, an energy company could sell these futures. Additionally, it could buy options or other complex trading products. The energy market is in that aspect very similar to the stock market and its derivative products. The only difference with the stock market is that not stocks, but electricity is being traded.

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__8XHz8RGvNANECXm3__g9VPA.png)

Energy companies have large numbers of customers, sometimes millions, with long-term contracts. This gives them certainty about electricity demand in the next few years. With that certainty comes the option of buying futures. For example, futures for Dutch power for the next four years are prices around 45–55 $/MWh. Futures are a lot more price stable than the spot market and allow time to respond to market changes.

While energy companies can ‘lock’ the price for electricity years in advance and are only risking about 20% of their volume to the spot market, someone with a variable pricing plan would be exposed to 100% to the spot market.

### Variable pricing: the energy company wins

Electricity prices fluctuate and thus provide a risk for those who depend on them. In a fixed pricing plan, that risk lies with the energy company. That energy company can mitigate that risk by using its sheer volume of customers and actively participate in future and option trading.

But in a variable price plan, the risk lies with you as the end-consumer. And you cannot trade on the futures market, don’t have a lot of volumes, and are limited in how much electricity demand can be shifted.

You are also subject to possible price manipulations in which spot market prices are intentionally kept high by withholding electricity capacity from the market. Enron’s price gouging in 2001 may still be remembered. And w[hile the New Zealand company Meridian may have to pay their variable pricing plan customers compensation](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/438143/meridian-contact-facing-hefty-bills-consumers-to-get-refunds-after-undesirable-trading-situation) for not playing by the rules, it comes as too little and too late for those affected.

In the end, variable pricing plans are nothing but moving the small amount of risk that energy companies have to consumers, who have to bear a much greater risk.

Safety is in numbers, which is the case when it comes to energy trading. And while solutions such as energy storage or demand response may provide the consumer with risk mitigation options, they are still far away from being affordable.

Stick with a fixed price plan, or risk a $17,000 energy bill.
