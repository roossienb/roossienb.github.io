Today, the Dutch Financial Times newspaper published [an article](https://fd.nl/ondernemen/1410234/overschot-aan-groene-stroom-is-kostenpost-voor-energiebedrijven-ibi1cac8G2S), stating that the surplus in green electricity is costing energy companies money. With the overabundance in electricity on the market at times, companies have to pay to sell their electricity. But there is catch: The Netherlands doesn’t have nearly as much green electricity to oversupply the country. So what is happening here?

#### Hidden coal

In an early article, I described [how the spot market works through a merit order of generation](https://bartroossien.com/why-you-should-never-choose-a-variable-rate-electricity-plan-d91f012000ed#2bfb). In short, the cheapest generation is called in first to cover the demand, Then the second cheapest, third cheapest etc. until the demand is covered.

Renewable energy, such as wind and solar, are cheap to operate as they require no fuel. So when there is a lot of green energy being produced, fossil fuel power plants have to shut down.

But what if those power plants don’t want to shut down? The only way to do that is to undercut the green energy sources by bidding a negative price: they are offering money to the buyer of electricity. Yes, that’s right. If you buy electricity at that point, you get money.

So why are these power plants doing that, because obviously, they are making a loss?

It turns out that a lot of district heating grids (pipes in the ground that provide buildings with hot water for heating and domestic hot water usage) are fed by fossil fuel power plants.

A power plant has an electric efficiency of around 40% (for coal) to 60% (for natural gas). The remaining energy when burning fossil fuels is released as heat.

As district heating grid companies cannot stop their supply of heat, people end up with a cold house or cold shower, those power plants need to keep running, at all cost.

So while coal and gas-fired power plants should shut down when it is a nice windy summer day, they cannot shut down as they are obliged to provide heat. So they undercut green electricity so they are allowed to stay operational.

#### Blame the system, not the technology

The intertwining of high temperature district heating with electricity production is the main problem here, not green energy. But the Dutch article isn’t the first one blaming green energy for system failures. Some Republicans in the US [are blaming wind energy](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/abbott-republicans-green-energy/) for the Texas outage in early February of this year. But the majority of power loss came from fossil fuel power plants.

In the Netherlands, there are an increasing amount of project using low temperature district heating, such as [5th generation district heating and cooling grids](https://5gdhc.eu/). Moving towards lower temperatures (below < 50 °C) reduces the dependence on high temperature sources, which are scarce outside of waste heat from fossil fuel power plants and incinerators.

Green energy requires a flexible system to manage its fluctuations. However, the current energy system is designed around inflexible fossil fuel power plants. The solution is move towards a more flexible energy system, not to blame green energy.
