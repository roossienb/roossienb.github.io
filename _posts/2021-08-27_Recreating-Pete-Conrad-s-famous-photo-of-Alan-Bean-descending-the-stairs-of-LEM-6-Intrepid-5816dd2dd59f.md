Revell 1:48 Lunar Module Eagle scale model with customizations.

I love the Lunar Module. Although it is now more than 50 years ago, even today it stands as an engineering masterpiece. And it is the only real spaceship humankind has ever made.

One NASA picture that captures its ingenuity and peculiar design is astronaut Alan Bean descending the LEM-6 ‘Intrepid’ ladder. The picture was taken by the Commander of the Apollo 12 mission, Pete Conrad.

A recreation of this picture felt in place to tribute both the LEM and the crew of the Apollo 12 mission by building the [Revell 1/48 Lunar Module (ID: 03701)](https://www.revell.de/en/products/modelmaking/space-scifi/apollo-11-lunar-module-eagle.html). This scale model represents the ‘Eagle’, the Lunar Module on the Apollo 11 mission, where astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin were the first humans to set foot on the Moon. Some modifications were needed to make it the ‘Intrepid’.

### The kit

The kit costs around 50 euro’s and comes in the ’50 year moon landing’ anniversary package. It is not Revell’s first release of the Lunar Module. Its earlier releases were all made with the original tool from 1968. Fortunately, Revell decided to use [Dragon’s 2011 v](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/revell-03701-apollo-11-lunar-module-eagle--1182705)ersion, which came with a brand new tool.

And this is clearly noticeable. The plastic is of good quality. The fit is (almost) perfect. I did not need any filler. Only the landing legs had a bit of flash that was easily removed

Build instructions are provided in the [new Revell colour booklet](https://downloads.revell.de/Manuals-Modelkits/03701.pdf), instead of the older black&white paper format and are easy to follow. The ascend (grey/black) and descend (gold) modules of the model are built separately and are joined without glue.

Some of the plastic parts provided in the sprues are not used. I believe they are for an option with the landing legs folded (the position in the Lunar Module was transported by the Saturn V rocket), but that option isn’t explained in the booklet. As my version would be landed on the moon, I didn’t explore these parts further.

Building this kit is very straightforward. It didn’t feel like a ‘Level 4’ kit, except for the landing gears. Those can be a bit fiddly and require lots of dry-fitting and patience.

### Painting

Painting the kit turned out to be a challenge. Every Lunar Module had a different colour scheme. The colour scheme that Revell provides is that of the LEM-5 ‘Eagle’ (although it is not entirely correct), but I wanted the colour scheme for LEM-6.

The main difference among LEM colour schemes is which planes of the ascend stage are matt black.

I used NASA’s [pictures of the Apollo 12 mission](https://apollomaniacs.com/apollo/mission_as507_photo_e.htm) to reference the colour scheme. The number of pictures taken was limited and not all angles were properly covered, making it difficult to figure out the entire colour scheme, but I believe I nailed it.

### Customization: Alan Bean

No astronaut figurines are provided by Revell, so I had to find my own. I figured that someone must have 3D printed it, but with a lack of a 3D printer, I also needed someone to print it for me. I was very happy when I found the [Apollo 11 / Ladder position on Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/product/VVTSPCNWD/apollo-11-ladder-position?productConfiguration=63101419&etId=196013167&optionId=63101419). The 1/48 smooth fine version currently goes for about 14 euro’s, although I’m pretty sure I paid triple the price when I bought it.

The only thing left was to give it a quick paint and glue it on the ladder.

### The Result
