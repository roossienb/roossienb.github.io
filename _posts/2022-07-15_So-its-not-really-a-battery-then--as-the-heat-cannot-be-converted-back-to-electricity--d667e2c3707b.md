So its not really a battery then, as the heat cannot be converted back to electricity.

That begs the question, why sand? Sand has a thermal capacity of 840 J/kg/K, whereas water has a thermal capacity almost five times that amount at 4200 J/kg/K

The only upside with sand, is that you can heat it beyond 100 °C, which isn't possible with water (it will turn into steam, which is difficult to store).

There are storage projects based on sand-like material, such as basalt rock. However, these projects heat these materials up to 5,000 °C, so it is hot enough to use in a generator to convert back to electricity.
