Black Friday and the ensuing Cyber Monday take place this week from the 26th to the 29th of November. This once-American tradition, where shops offer seemingly large discounts on their products, has found its way across the world. But while consumers salivate over the upcoming bargains, the environment is shuddering in fear over the damage being done.

Black Friday is the epiphany of modern-day consumerism. Well-placed marketing campaigns and the sense of amazing deals push people into the fear of missing out on products they don’t need.

Many of these products are shipped from overseas (China) to global warehouses and then distributed to the buyers.

A lot of attention goes to the environmental impact of delivering the packages. Estimations are that Black Friday package deliveries result in an additional 4[00 million kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions in the United Kingdom alone](https://www.money.co.uk/credit-cards/dirty-delivery-report). That is the same as 100,000 people flying from London to Sydney and back. Yes, you read that right, a hundred thousand people!

Carbon dioxide emissions are not the only problem though. The delivery vans, often diesel-powered, also have a [serious impact on the air quality](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/24/black-friday-to-cause-spikes-in-air-pollution-and-plastic-waste-warn-environmentalists).

The call to reduce the impact of Black Friday purchase deliveries has slowly increased in past years. One suggestion is that consumers reduce their [emissions by combining multiple products into one order delivery](https://fashionunited.com/news/retail/black-friday-has-a-carbon-emissions-problem/2020111336476).

However, the impact of such action is overestimated. A single shop may not have all the great deals the consumer looks for. Furthermore, many retailers like Amazon offer products from third-party suppliers, where each supplier ships their product. A combined order then still leads to multiple packages being sent off.

While the call to reduce the number of package deliveries is good, it doesn’t touch the real environmental problem.

### Overconsumption

The products we buy are made of depleting (e.g. metals) or polluting (e.g. plastics) resources. Production occurs in carbon-intensive industries with chemical waste as by-products that too often end up in the environment.

Additionally, products are quickly discarded because they are no longer the latest trend, [cannot be easily repaired](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting) and [won’t be recycled](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2020/03/13/fix-recycling-america/). It ends up in a landfill or incinerator, [neither of which are environmentally friendly](http://www.energyjustice.net/files/incineration/incineration_vs_landfills_DC.pdf).

And let’s be honest. That TV you bought last year on Black Friday doesn’t need an upgrade. And all those plastic toys you thought you needed, will end up unused in a plastic box somewhere in the garage, to be thrown away in 10 years when you find them again.

> The decision to buy a product is the biggest environmental polluter.

Shockingly, [Amazon hauling is a thing](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=amazon+haul) where p[eople buy random stuff at 3 am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC7eBSDmoCM) and are rewarded with Youtube views and advertisement money.

Society has created a world in which people fear they miss out if they don’t possess the latest products.

Worse is that many of these products are returned. [Amazon destroys millions of, often unused and still packaged, products a year, in many cases dumping them in landfills instead of proper recycling](https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds), reselling, or given away to charity.

Additionally, many products are packaged in plastic. [Amazon alone is responsible for a quarter-billion kilograms of plastic waste per year](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22174990/amazon-packaging-millions-pounds-plastic-waste-oceans-pollution-oceana).

### Stop buying!

While there are many ways to reduce the environmental impact of shopping, from electric vans for last-mile delivery to sustainable packaging and reusing, repairing, and recycling products, **the largest impact a shopper has is by not buying the product in the first place**.

So instead of going into a buying frenzy, take a deep breath and look at the product again. Do you need that product? Are you absolutely sure? And if you really need it, what is its lifetime? Is it future-proof? And repairable? What about recyclable?

Reducing our consumption is a significant step forward in creating a cleaner Earth. A great side-effect is that it also saves you money. That money can be used to pay off debt, [invest in a bee-friendly garden](https://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/how-to-make-a-bee-friendly-garden/), or donate it to charity.
