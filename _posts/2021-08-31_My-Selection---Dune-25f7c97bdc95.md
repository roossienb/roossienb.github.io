Frank Herbert’s prescience into modern-day societal challenges.

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__eUgmqRw9rebDUuOPLy5Ksw.jpeg)

I was fourteen years old when I fell in love with the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune. Initially, it was not the 1965 published book that got me into it. Nor was it David Lynch’s 1984 movie adaption.

Instead, it was Westwood’s “Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty” computer game. By many, this game is seen as the father of all real-time-strategy (RTS) games, such as Command & Conquer, Warcraft, and Starcraft. The game takes Dune’s world-building, but it does not follow the storyline of the book.

I was not an avid reader, but the world of Dune itself was enough to convince me to pick up the book from the local library. I had heard it was better original language (English) rather than a translation (I am a non-native English speaker).

Luckily, the library did have a copy of the English version. Reading such a complex book in English was quite an achievement for me as a teenager. Frank Herbert is a literary writer that picks his words very precisely to convey his meaning of the many layers in the storyline. Picking up on these subtleties can be hard. Nonetheless, I loved the book and finished its almost 900 pages in just three days.

Since then, I have read the book countless times, and every time I find something new that I had not picked up before.

### Story

The main story of the book is about a teenage boy, the future Duke of House Atreides. He is growing up in a universe over 10,000 years from now, with faster-than-light space ships and lasers. But science fiction plays only a minor part in the book.

It all revolves around a substance called ‘Spice’ that “extends life, expands conscience and allows for safe space travel through prescience”. Spice is found only on the desert planet of Arrakis, commonly known as ‘Dune’. Harvesting Spice is dangerous. The lack of water on the planet can easily kill you. But the largest threats are from giant sandworms, up to 400 metres long, which will attack anything in the sands of Dune.

This makes Spice a scarce and expensive commodity, its presence influencing economy, politics, and religion in the Empire of the Known Universe. As Frank Herbert puts it, “He who controls Dune, controls the Spice. He ho controls the Spice, controls the universe”. And that makes planet Arrakis the home of planning and plotting for anyone desiring power in the Empire.

In this setting, House Atreides is asked to take over the mining production of Spice on Dune. Their task is to get Spice production back in line after their long-term arch-enemy House Harkonnen failed to meet the Emperial quota.

### Reflection

Dune is more than a story about a teenage boy growing up. Herbert performed extensive research on modern society before writing Dune. His results of this research are projected into Dune. While Frank Herbert wrote Dune in the early 1960s, his reflections on modern society still hold up in 2021.

His projections focus on segregation within society, such as _us_ versus _them_ mentality and _rich_ versus _poor_, and the use of marketing and religion to push and maintain those segregations. Those actors are still found in modern-day society.

A prime example is modern-day US politics, where the _poor_ are kept poor utilizing policies focussing on low wages, high student debt and high medical costs and by using marketing in making those same people believe that these policies are what makes “America great”.

Another great example is the addiction to Spice. It is the perfect metaphor for our world’s addiction to oil. We cannot do without it. Our economy and our political alliances and policies are controlled through this addiction, just like in Dune.

But Dune is not about good versus evil. It looks like House Atreides are the ‘good guys’ and House Harkonnen the ‘bad guys. But the further you get into the book, the more you questions whether the Atreides are really good guys and if the Harkonnen really evil, or just a product of the system.

In that perspective, his second book, ‘Dune Messiah’, is Herbert's real masterpiece. For the real Dune fans, it may be a hard pill to swallow in which supposedly heroes turn into anti-heroes. It demonstrates how hard it is to change a system, despite revolutions that took place. “The emperor is dead, long live the emperor”.

The explorative journey of Frank Herbert really takes off with the five successor books (Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapter House Dune) in the series. This makes all six books well worth a read multiple times.
