In the past few months, [prices for natural gas have skyrocketed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/natural-gas-prices-are-skyrocketing-globally-what-it-means-for-the-us.html). In northwest Europe, wholesale prices have tenfold since the start of this year. While the transition towards a clean energy supply is boosted by the high fossil fuel prices, several short term drawback could make it really ugly this winter.

### Why are natural gas prices so high?

It is the combination of multiple factors that have increased the demand for natural gas together with a reduced supply.

#### Long winter

In many European countries, natural gas is a direct or indirect source of space heating. The 2020–2021 winter in Europe was quite long. While the first three months had average temperatures equal to the long term average, the months April and May were 2 °C below average. This has lead to a significant increase in natural gas consumption for space heating and a depletion of the reserves.

#### The end of Corona

With the Corona pandemic at an end, business and industries have ramped up their activities to pre-Corona levels. Many industries use natural gas directly for heating and steam production. Additionally, the demand for electricity has also increased. In Europe, a significant part of electricity is produced by natural gas-fired power plants.

#### Low production

While demand for natural gas has increased this summer, the supply and production of natural gas is still at pandemic levels.

After all, earlier this year prices were at an all-time low, removing any incentive to increase production. Furthermore, Europe is starting to reach the depletion of its natural gas wells, making gas extraction more expensive.

Social resistance against gas extraction has also increased. The Dutch government for example has stopped all on-land gas extraction in the province of Groningen due to increased extraction-related earthquake activity, affecting hundreds of thousands of houses in the area.

#### Winter is coming

With low gas reserves, increasing demand and lacking supply, countries are concerned about the possibility of a strong winter. If one would occur, current natural gas reserves would be insufficient. Depletion during winter time would create significant social and economical damage: people that cannot afford their energy bills may freeze to death and industries would have to shut down. [The U.S. state of Texas learned everything about this earlier this year](https://bartroossien.com/why-you-should-never-choose-a-variable-rate-electricity-plan-d91f012000ed).

It is not yet clear whether we will get a strong winter. So far, winters are getting milder due to climate change. As I’m writing this, it is 17 °C and sunny outside on October 9th. There have been years in the past where the temperature would be near freezing point.

#### Geopolitics

A fourth cause is a powerplay by Russia. Russia is by far the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe. The main pipeline goes through Ukraine and Poland before it reaches Germany and the Netherlands, from which it is distributed through the rest of Europe.

In the past, Russia has reduced gas supply through this pipeline several times due to payment conflicts with Ukraine and Poland, affecting the supply in the whole of Europe.

Therefore, in 2006 Russia and Germany started to build a new pipeline through the Baltic sea, called [Nord Stream](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Stream). Its success led to the construction of a sister pipeline, Nord Stream 2, of which construction was finished in [September 2021](https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-russia-ukraine-poland-730b419312303fe6cbdf215c4420eaa4).

Commissioning this pipeline hasn’t been completed yet. There is a lot of opposition against it, especially from the United States. President Biden has been very outspoken on the risks for Poland and Ukraine. Gas supply to West-Europe would be guaranteed, while Russia could use the gas supply to Poland and Ukraine to gain more influence.

By limiting supply to Europe, Russia is pushing Europe for opening Nord Stream 2.

Natural gas is a powerful geopolitical weapon. I’ve written before about the [secret Dutch-Russian gas deal](https://bartroossien.com/why-energy-transition-is-about-more-than-climate-change-610c3083cfbd), despite The Netherlands still trying to prosecute the Russians for shooting down MH19.

### The Bad

In many European countries, like the Netherlands, natural gas is an important source of electricity generation. As natural gas is relatively expensive, even when it is cheap, natural gas-fired power plants are dictating the electricity price as they are last in the [merit order](https://bartroossien.com/why-you-should-never-choose-a-variable-rate-electricity-plan-d91f012000ed#2bfb).

As a result, electricity prices have gone up, at some moments [well above 400 €/MWh](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janwillemzwang_het-houdt-niet-op-niet-vanzelf-morgen-activity-6851529910117298176-1UG_), 10 times as high as average.

![](D:\Documents\Blog\Medium archive\Posts\md_1694113268620\img\1__Wc2xelc55JFpahV0LnV0OA.png)

This poses a major risk from a carbon emissions perspective. The last time natural gas was expensive (around 2008), natural-gas-fired power plants were shut down or decommissioned in favour of (new) coal-fired power plants. However, [coal power plants emit about 800 grams of carbon dioxide per produced kWh of electricity, while a gas-fired power plant emits half of that](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/CO2-spez/index_e.php).

If natural gas prices stay high, energy companies and governments may opt to open up coal-fired power plants again, undoing all the hard work to get these closed to reduce global carbon emissions.

### The Good

These high gas prices are not all bad. The continuous price increase has drawn more and more media attention, making people aware of the pending increase in energy bills. And with it, the increased awareness in energy efficiency and self-production of sustainable energy.

For most people and industries, financial payback times (the time it takes to pay back the investment from the reduction in energy bill) is still the prime driver in decision making. This despite many more reasons that also warrant the investment (e.g. better air quality, more comfort, caring for climate and environment, ensuring multi-generation welfare).

With higher natural gas prices, the payback times are lower, giving homeowners and industry the incentive to take energy-saving measures.

Additionally, the myth that fossil fuels are an always reliable and affordable energy supply begins to show cracks. This is important in the discussion about renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy. Opponents of renewable energy often use their intermittency as an argument of why the world cannot move towards them

### The Ugly

While high natural gas prices in the long term may likely lead to energy efficiency, in the short term it can get real ugly.

#### Energy poverty

Currently, between 50 and 125 million people in Europe suffer from [energy poverty](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/content/introduction-5_en). Although an exact definition doesn’t exist yet, energy poverty can be seen as people with low income that cannot afford the energy bill and therefore live in an uncomfortable house.

With natural gas prices increasing, the energy bill goes up. I extended my energy contract in June, paying around 80 Eurocent per m3 of natural gas and 21 Eurocents per kWh of electricity. I should consider myself very lucky. My colleague who is renewing his contract this week has an offer of € 1.40 per m3 and 34 Eurocents per kWh. That is an increase of 50% in 3 months time!

People with lower incomes will not be able to afford this rise in energy bills. Additionally, it is harder for them to take energy efficiency measures. They lack the financial means to invest, but also because they don’t own the home they live in.

Luckily, many social housing corporations in the Netherlands have been updating their assets in the past ten years, making them more energy efficient. But if you struggle to make ends meet, even a slight increase in energy bill has major impact.

#### Energy company bankruptcy

My energy contract prices are fixed for a year. This gives me certainty about how much I pay and gives the energy company certainty that I am a customer for a year. The energy company has to buy my energy for the entire year. The risk that the buy price goes up is for them (and so are the benefits if the price goes down).

This risk can be mitigated using something called futures, which allows an energy company to buy energy that is delivered at a time somewhere in the future. I’ve discussed this extensively in one of my earlier articles.

[**Why you should never choose a variable rate electricity plan.**  
_And avoid getting a $17,000 energy bill._bartroossien.com](https://bartroossien.com/why-you-should-never-choose-a-variable-rate-electricity-plan-d91f012000ed "https://bartroossien.com/why-you-should-never-choose-a-variable-rate-electricity-plan-d91f012000ed")[](https://bartroossien.com/why-you-should-never-choose-a-variable-rate-electricity-plan-d91f012000ed)

The larger the energy company, the easier the risk mitigation is. Smaller energy companies may struggle however. [Several energy companies in the UK have gone bankrupt](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58610561) because their risk mitigation was insufficient in comparison to the steep rise in natural gas price. And although their customers won’t be cut off from the energy supply, their contracts are void. Any money paid upfront may be gone and the new contract involve top-dollar energy prices.

### Future

It is uncertain what the future holds. In the past few days, natural gas prices have come down a bit again. This could be a return to more affordable gas prices or a temporarily hold in stocking up the reserves.

Furthermore, it has yet to be seen if natural gas prices stay this high in the long term. The current concerns involve upcoming winter only. Once spring 2022 has arrived, reserves can be replenished again. Additionally, it is expected that the Nord Stream 2 will be operational and that production from European countries such as Norway will be increased.

Natural gas futures currently show that prices for gas delivered after this winter are significantly lower. But it has yet to been seen if we see the all-time low of 13 €/MWh ever again.

### Afterword

The high natural gas prices are a good boost to increase awareness of energy efficiency and sustainability. Hopefully, it results in increased action towards a sustainable built environment.

In the short term, there are serious consequences to this rapid price increase. Carbon emissions may increase, more people may struggle with their energy bills and energy companies go bankrupt.

Governments will have to take action to soften the short-term pain of the price increase as energy is the core for our welfare.

However, it is yet to be seen whether these prices are here to stay. The market is currently expecting these prices to go back to normal after this winter. All may depend on how strong or mild this winter will be.
